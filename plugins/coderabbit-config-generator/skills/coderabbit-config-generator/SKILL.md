# CodeRabbit Configuration Generator

Generates project-specific `.coderabbit.yaml` files by analyzing a repository's PR history, bug patterns, and existing tooling to create custom review rules.

## When to Use

- Setting up CodeRabbit for a new repository
- Migrating from another code review tool to CodeRabbit
- Updating CodeRabbit config after identifying new bug patterns
- Creating custom checks based on project-specific anti-patterns

## When NOT to Use

- The user wants general code review guidance (not CodeRabbit-specific)
- The repository has no PR history to analyze (brand-new repo with no merges)
- The user already has a `.coderabbit.yaml` and only wants to edit a single field manually
- The user needs CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions, etc.) rather than review rules

## Workflow

### Automated workflow (recommended)

Prerequisites:
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) authenticated
- Python 3 on your `PATH`
- Local git clone of the repository

Run the analyzer scripts bundled with this skill:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/run_analysis.sh --repo-path /path/to/repo --repo owner/name
```

Outputs:
- `analysis/pr-data.json`
- `analysis/commit-log.txt`
- `analysis/pattern-report.json`

Adjust the lookback window or output directory as needed:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/run_analysis.sh \
  --repo-path /path/to/repo \
  --repo owner/name \
  --days 90 \
  --out-dir analysis
```

To add or tune patterns, edit `{baseDir}/scripts/patterns.json`.

### Step 1: Gather PR and Commit History

Collect recent merge history to identify patterns:

```bash
# Get merged PRs from last 2 months with details
gh pr list --state merged --limit 50 --json number,title,body,labels,mergedAt

# Get commit history for pattern analysis
git log --oneline --since="2 months ago" --pretty=format:"%h %s"

# Get PR descriptions that mention bugs or fixes
gh pr list --state merged --limit 50 --json title,body | jq '.[] | select(.title | test("fix|bug|patch|hotfix"; "i"))'
```

### Step 2: Identify Bug Patterns

Look for recurring issues in PR titles and bodies:

| Pattern Keyword | Likely Issue | Custom Check Target |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| `fix:`, `bug:` | General bugs | Root cause category |
| `shallow copy`, `deepcopy` | Mutable default corruption | Shallow copy mutation |
| `abort`, `cancel`, `cleanup` | Exception path issues | Exception cleanup |
| `state`, `corrupt`, `invalid` | State management bugs | State invariants |
| `type:`, `typing` | Type safety issues | Type annotation checks |
| `frozen`, `immutable` | Mutation of immutables | Frozen object mutation |
| `circular`, `import` | Dependency violations | Import direction |
| `silent`, `swallow` | Error suppression | Silent failure detection |

### Step 3: Read Project Standards

Gather existing configuration and standards:

```bash
# Project coding standards
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null || cat .github/CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null

# Python tooling configuration
cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | grep -A 50 "\[tool.ruff\]"
cat pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | grep -A 20 "\[tool.mypy\]"

# Pre-commit hooks
cat .pre-commit-config.yaml 2>/dev/null

# Existing CodeRabbit config (if updating)
cat .coderabbit.yaml 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 4: Generate Configuration

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** CodeRabbit's schema only allows a maximum of **5 custom_checks** in `pre_merge_checks.custom_checks`. Do not exceed this limit or the config will fail validation.

Prioritize checks based on bug frequency and severity. If more than 5 patterns are identified, either:
- Combine related checks into one
- Use path_instructions for less critical patterns
- Skip style-only checks if pre-commit hooks already cover them

Create `.coderabbit.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json
language: "en-US"
tone_instructions: "Be direct and technical. Focus on correctness and maintainability."

reviews:
  profile: "chill"  # or "assertive" for stricter reviews
  review_status: true  # Set to false to disable status comments and only trigger via labels/flags

  path_filters:
    - "!**/*.md"
    - "!docs/**"
    - "!**/assets/**"
    - "!**/*.lock"
    - "!**/generated/**"
    - "!**/__pycache__/**"

  path_instructions:
    - path: "src/**/core/**"
      instructions: |
        This is the core business logic. Pay special attention to:
        - State invariants and cleanup in exception paths
        - Dependency direction (core should not import from ui/)
        - Contract violations (preconditions/postconditions)

    - path: "src/**/tools/**"
      instructions: |
        Tool implementations must:
        - Fail fast with clear error messages
        - Never silently return None on errors
        - Validate preconditions explicitly

    - path: "src/**/ui/**"
      instructions: |
        UI code should:
        - Not contain business logic
        - Not import from core/ internals
        - Handle user-facing errors gracefully

  auto_review:
    enabled: true
    drafts: false
    ignore_title_keywords:
      - "WIP"
      - "DO NOT MERGE"
      - "draft"
    base_branches:
      - "main"
      - "master"

  pre_merge_checks:
    custom_checks:
      - name: "Shallow Copy Mutation"
        mode: "error"
        instructions: |
          Flag any code that:
          1. Uses .copy() on a dict/list that contains nested mutable objects
          2. Mutates a copied config dict in-place
          3. Modifies DEFAULT_* or CONSTANT_* values

          Safe alternatives:
          - Use copy.deepcopy() for nested structures
          - Create new dict instead of mutating
          - Assign to new variable, don't mutate in-place

      - name: "Exception Path Cleanup"
        mode: "warning"
        instructions: |
          For any stateful loop or transaction, verify:
          1. All exit paths (normal, exception, early return) leave state valid
          2. try/except blocks that catch mid-operation have cleanup
          3. Resources acquired before exception are released

          Pattern to flag:
          - State mutation followed by operation that can raise
          - No cleanup in except block for stateful operations

      - name: "Silent Failure Detection"
        mode: "error"
        instructions: |
          Flag these anti-patterns:
          1. Bare except: pass
          2. return None without logging on error path
          3. Catching exception and returning empty collection
          4. if not condition: return (without error indication)

          Required: Errors should be raised, logged, or explicitly documented.

      - name: "Dependency Direction"
        mode: "warning"
        instructions: |
          Verify import direction follows: ui -> core -> tools -> utils/types

          Flag violations:
          - core/ importing from ui/
          - tools/ importing from ui/
          - utils/ or types/ importing from higher layers

          Inner layers must not know about outer layers.

      - name: "Magic Number Detection"
        mode: "warning"
        instructions: |
          Flag numeric literals that should be named constants:
          - Timeout values (e.g., 30, 60, 300)
          - Size limits (e.g., 1024, 4096)
          - Retry counts (e.g., 3, 5)
          - Status codes

          Exception: 0, 1, -1 in common idioms are acceptable.

## Configuration Options

### Review Status Messages

By default, `review_status: true` posts a status comment on every PR indicating CodeRabbit is reviewing. To disable these status messages and only trigger reviews via labels or explicit flags, set:

```yaml
reviews:
  review_status: false
```

This is useful for high-volume repos where status messages add noise.

### Label-Gated Reviews

By default, auto_review runs on all PRs. To require specific labels before triggering a review, add:

```yaml
reviews:
  auto_review:
    labels:
      - "needs-review"
```

**Warning:** If labels are configured, PRs without those labels will be skipped.

## Custom Check Derivation Guide

**Maximum 5 custom_checks allowed.** Prioritize by bug severity and frequency.

Based on bug patterns found in Step 2, add appropriate custom checks:

### If Config Corruption Bugs Found

Add "Shallow Copy Mutation" check with mode "error".

### If State Corruption or Abort Bugs Found

Add "Exception Path Cleanup" check. Look for patterns like:
- User abort leaving invalid state
- Transaction incomplete after exception
- Resources not released

### If Pydantic/Dataclass Bugs Found

Add "Frozen Object Mutation" check:

```yaml
- name: "Frozen Object Mutation"
  mode: "error"
  instructions: |
    Flag attempts to modify frozen dataclasses or Pydantic models:
    1. Direct attribute assignment on frozen=True objects
    2. In-place mutation of frozen object's mutable fields
    3. Missing model_copy() for Pydantic v2 modifications
```

### If Type-Related Bugs Found

Add "Type Safety" check:

```yaml
- name: "Type Annotation Gaps"
  mode: "warning"
  instructions: |
    Flag:
    1. Functions without return type annotations
    2. Any/object types without justification
    3. cast() without # type: verified comment
    4. # type: ignore without explanation
```

## File Placement

The generated file MUST be named `.coderabbit.yaml` (with leading dot) and placed in the repository root.

## Validation

After generating, validate the configuration:

```bash
# Validate with the bundled script (requires PyYAML)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/validate_coderabbit_yaml.py --config .coderabbit.yaml

# Or check YAML syntax manually
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.coderabbit.yaml'))"

# Verify custom_checks count (max 5 allowed by CodeRabbit schema)
grep -A 1 "custom_checks:" .coderabbit.yaml | grep -c "name:" || true

# Verify custom check name lengths (must be under 50 chars)
grep "name:" .coderabbit.yaml | awk -F'"' '{print length($2), $2}' | awk '$1 > 50'
```

## Example: Analyzing Bug Patterns

Given these PR titles from history:

```
fix: shallow copy corrupts DEFAULT_USER_CONFIG
fix: dangling tool calls on user abort
fix: state manager not cleaning up on exception
```

The generator would add these checks with mode "error":
1. Shallow Copy Mutation
2. Exception Path Cleanup

(Leaving room for 3 more checks if needed — max 5 total)

And set path_instructions for core/ and tools/ to emphasize state management.

## Output

The skill produces:
1. `.coderabbit.yaml` in repository root
2. Summary of bug patterns that informed the configuration
3. Recommendations for additional custom checks based on project structure
